# Editorial, finishing, and final QC

Read this file when planning rough cut, pickups, post-production, delivery, or archive.

## Start editorial early

An accepted-looking isolated shot may still fail the film. Build a complete blocking cut early to reveal:

- coverage holes and absent story beats;
- repeated or slow beats;
- missing masters, reactions, inserts, exits, and transition handles;
- axis/eyeline/action mismatches;
- shots that are impressive but unusable in rhythm;
- where a cheaper edit/VFX route beats regeneration.

Rolling assembly was repeatedly described in project briefs, but no controlled study proved the ideal overlap. Treat it as a strong production starting policy, not a causal guarantee.

## Dailies and selects

- Review the complete clip, not its thumbnail.
- Inspect opening, middle, ending, cuts/transitions, and high-risk action/audio timecodes.
- Gate intra-shot quality, prompt/entity fidelity, cross-shot continuity, then neighbor edit.
- Keep incoming, rejected, selects, and approved memory distinct.
- Only accepted takes enter the edit; rejected takes remain in the ledger for diagnosis and never become identity truth.

## Rough cut and pickups

Cut for story and performance rather than sunk generation cost. Track:

- approved in/out and handles;
- temp VFX, reframes, speed-change intent and audio placeholders;
- missing coverage and prioritized pickups;
- downstream impact of each structure change.

Do not conceal dialogue retiming or continuity damage with undocumented time-stretch. Structure lock requires a change request for new shots or reordered state.

## Cleanup, VFX, and conform

Route defects deliberately:

- regenerate when the core shot contract is wrong but remains model-suitable;
- local AI edit or traditional paint/roto/key when a defect is bounded;
- reframe/cutaway/split when editorially recoverable;
- composite exact text/logo/UI instead of endlessly regenerating spelling;
- use simulation/3D/practical/live action for persistent physics/contact limits.

Normalize codec, frame rate, duration, color tags, audio channels and filenames into the project master. Preserve source media and transformations. Upscale/interpolate only with a defined need and inspect ghosting, edge distortion and texture crawl.

Conform against the delivered container, not against geometry drawn into the picture: bars, mattes, or a wider ratio inside the frame are content and travel with it. Reconcile each shot's target duration against the delivered clip length before conform, and route a systematic gap back to shot design instead of absorbing it in the timeline.

## Baked-in versus separable layers

Decide before shooting which elements are baked into the generated take and which are delivered as separate layers. Anything baked in cannot be re-timed, translated, remixed, or removed without rejecting the take, so the layer assignment is a production decision made at breakdown, not a preference discovered later in the mix.

- **Sound.** Assign every audio element to a layer before the first request. Shots ask only for the in-world sources belonging to that space and moment, drawn from the location and prop passports. Anything the mix must stay free to change — score, any non-diegetic element, anything whose timing, language or licensing is unsettled — is deferred to the mix and kept out of the request. Baking a musical or non-diegetic element into a take is a legitimate choice when the production wants it; record it as a decision with its cost noted, because changing it afterwards means re-running the shot.
- **On-screen text.** Keep a per-scene inventory of the text allowed to be visible in the delivered picture, each item with its source: in-world graphic, composited artwork, or none. Anything else the generator renders — captions, provider marks, invented signage, subtitle-like overlays — is a defect in an otherwise acceptable frame, because burned text cannot be conformed, translated, or re-timed and collides with any separate caption deliverable.
- The hard gate tests conformance to this plan, not the presence or absence of music: an accepted take carries no rendered text outside that scene's inventory and no audio outside its declared layer assignment.
- Picture-accepted and sound-rejected is a route, not an automatic re-run: mute and re-voice, or replace the audio layer, before spending a retry.

The prompt clauses that carry these restrictions belong to `seedance-prompt-director`; the layer assignment, the inventory, and the gate are production decisions.

## Color and sound

Color checks: shot match, motivated light, skin/material fidelity, day/weather state, gradients/banding, legal range and calibrated playback. A container or `4k` badge does not identify generation resolution, bit depth or color pipeline.

Sound checks: exact dialogue, speaker/voice identity, pronunciation, lip-sync, perspective, room tone across cuts, action-linked foley, music motif, silence, loudness, channels and delivery. Generated sound may guide timing but does not replace professional cleanup/mix.

Use ADR/dubbing when picture is usable and model speech is not. Keep voice rights and pronunciation dictionary in the passport.

## Subtitles

Time subtitles from the final video's actual audio, never from prompt milestones. Verify language, speaker, transcription, punctuation, line breaks, reading speed, safe area, occlusion, cross-cut behavior, and burned-versus-sidecar delivery.

## Final QC and archive

Use at least one full uninterrupted master playback plus targeted checks of every edit, VFX, subtitle and audio transition.

Technical QC:

- duration, aspect, resolution, frame rate, codec/container and color tags;
- duplicate/drop/freeze/black frames and compression artifacts;
- audio channels, sync, clipping/peaks/loudness;
- subtitle format/timing/safe area;
- delivery naming and checksum.

Content QC:

- story and required beats;
- identity, wardrobe/injury, prop/location/weather continuity;
- anatomy, motion, physics/contact, camera and text;
- dialogue/sound/music/subtitles;
- rights, policy, disclosure and watermark requirements.

Archive master/mezzanine, stems, subtitle files, project/timeline files, prompt/reference/state/run ledgers, approved/rejected decisions, tool/model/platform/doc versions, hashes, approvals, waivers and rollback checkpoints. Never archive signed media queries or credentials.
